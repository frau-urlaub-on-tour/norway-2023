The first stretch will take me from Neustadt via Bremen to Hirtshals in North Denmark, a distance of 1.210 km. From there it'll be a 16,5 hour night crossing on the car ferry to Bergen.Â </p>\n<p>The next 4 days will be spent going further up the North West coast of Norway, 1.480 km in total, to reach Bodo on Friday, 25 August. Here, I will pick up Medha at the airport. Together, we will cross over to the Lofoten which we intend to explore during the following week. Hopefully not only in the rain; we'll see. The weather is known to be very unpredictable up there.</p>",
